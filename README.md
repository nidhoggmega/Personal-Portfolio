It was a hard experience to design my own webpage without any help from templates.<br>
Some parts that requires testing:
1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
2. Project showcase:
    1.Go to the "Project" page
    2.Try to click on a interactable picture under project title and verify that it will jump to the project page.
3. To top button:
    1.Go to any page
    2.Try to scroll down a bit
    3.Click on the Top button to verify that it will go to the top of the page.
